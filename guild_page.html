        <div class="section">
            <h2>What is a Guild?</h2>
            <p>Historically, guilds were associations of skilled craftspeople and merchants in medieval and Renaissance Europe who maintained quality standards, supported member development, protected trade interests, and shared knowledge for the common good. Guilds ensured that expertise was passed down through apprenticeships, that practitioners maintained ethical standards, and that the broader community benefited from their skills.</p>

            <h2>Our Modern Guild Model</h2>
            <p>We're reviving this time-tested approach for regenerative work practitioners in the 21st century. Our guild serves people who want to create livelihood around organizational transformation, community building, facilitation, coaching, and systems change workâ€”all grounded in our commons-developed wisdom.</p>

            <h3>Who This Serves</h3>
            <p>Consultants, coaches, facilitators, organizational development practitioners, community organizers, and anyone wanting to earn income by applying regenerative approaches to work. Whether you're experienced or just starting, the guild provides pathways for developing expertise and creating sustainable practice.</p>

            <h3>What We Organize Around</h3>
            <p>Our guild maintains quality standards for applying the Metawork Framework, supports practitioners in developing skills through commons participation, shares knowledge about effective approaches, and ensures that professional services remain connected to and accountable to the regenerative principles we develop together.</p>

        <!-- How It Works -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>We help people <strong>learn</strong> frameworks in the commons, <strong>apply</strong> them in real contexts, <strong>incubate</strong> new approaches through experimentation, <strong>transform</strong> organizations and communities, and <strong>proliferate</strong> these methods throughout their networks.</p>

                <h4>How the Ecosystem Synergy Works</h4>
                <p>Like fruits that grow from healthy trees, practitioners develop deep understanding through commons participation (the soil), then apply this wisdom in professional contexts, and bring insights back to enrich the commons. The professional work funds commons activities, while commons learning continuously improves professional offeringsâ€”creating a regenerative cycle that strengthens the whole ecosystem.</p>

            <p>We recognize that people have both contribution desires and livelihood needs. We've intentionally created multiple pathways so that meaningful participation isn't limited by financial circumstances, while also offering opportunities for people to create sustainable income without compromising their integrity.</p>

            <h2>Professional Services & Guild-Based Livelihood</h2>
            <p>We're not a consulting company, but we do believe that the wisdom developed in our commons can and should create sustainable livelihoods for practitioners. Here's how we approach this:</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>We connect practitioners to existing cooperative business entities or help them launch their own practice with guild support. Our business entities are structured as cooperative LLCs that enable professional services while maintaining our values.</p>

                <h4>For Organizations Wanting to Hire Us</h4>
                <p>When you engage our guild members' professional services, you're working with practitioners who are deeply embedded in this living ecosystem. They bring not just frameworks and tools, but the embodied experience of these approaches and ongoing connection to a community of practice. This means more authentic implementation and continued support beyond any single engagement.</p>

                <h4>Let's Be Honest About Money</h4>
                <p>Most people doing this work have some financial privilegeâ€”savings, partners with steady income, or skills that translate to freelancing. We're working to change this through our mutual aid fund and transition support programs, but it's important to be transparent about current realities.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What We're Building</h3>
            <p>We're developing more accessible pathways for people with significant financial obligationsâ€”mortgages, student loans, medical debt, family support responsibilities. This includes:</p>

            <h3>For Practitioners Seeking Livelihood</h3>
            <p>If you want to earn income by applying these approaches professionally, the guild pathway allows you to develop expertise through commons participation, then offer services while maintaining integrity and community connection.</p>
            
            <p><em>This is for you if: You want to create livelihood aligned with your values rather than compromise your integrity for income, and you can commit to the community participation needed to develop authentic expertise.</em></p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Most people start with commons participation (attending gatherings, following content), develop expertise through project involvement, and then discover which pathwaysâ€”volunteer, project-based, or professionalâ€”align with their circumstances and calling. You can move between pathways as your situation evolves, and many people participate in multiple ways simultaneously.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">

                <p>Commons participation â†’ Skills development through projects â†’ Professional service offerings â†’ Income generation while maintaining community accountability. This typically takes 6-18 months of consistent engagement to develop the depth needed for authentic professional practice.</p>
