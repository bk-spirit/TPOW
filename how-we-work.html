        <!-- Learning Ecosystem Structure -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Our Learning Ecosystem: A Commons-Based Forest</h2>
            <p>We organize learning through three interconnected layers that function like a healthy forest ecosystem. Drawing from Elinor Ostrom's work on common resource pooling, each layer follows regenerative design principles where resources flow naturally between levels, creating abundance rather than scarcity.</p>
            
            <div class="ecosystem-layers">
                <div class="layer-card soil">
                    <h4>Soil/Commons Layer - The Foundational Nutrients</h4>
                    <p>Like rich forest soil that provides nutrients for all plant life, this layer contains our shared resources, wisdom, and relationships. Monthly community calls, open-source toolkits, our peer-to-peer podcast, and ongoing conversations create the fertile ground where everything else grows. Resources here are freely accessible and collectively maintained, following gift economy principles where contribution strengthens rather than depletes the commons.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="layer-card knots">
                    <h4>Knots Layer - Where Individual Learning Happens</h4>
                    <p>As Raimón Panikkar said, "A person is a knot in a net of relationships." Like specific trees and plants in a forest that create distinct growing environments, these are our dojos and guilds where people develop particular skills while tending the relationships that constitute them. CommDojo, Conflict Kinship Dojo, and learning guilds each create their own learning "microclimate" while drawing from and contributing back to the commons.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card social-web">
                    <h4>Social Web Layer - Where Collective Impact Happens</h4>
                    <p>Like the forest canopy where different species interact and create conditions for rain and air circulation, this is where individual learning translates into collective action. Deep dive labs, organizational consulting, and cross-pollination between different learning communities create the conditions for larger systems transformation while feeding insights back down to enrich the commons.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>How Resource Pooling Works:</h4>
                <p>Following Ostrom's principles, our commons are self-governed by participants rather than external authorities. People contribute what they can (time, skills, money, attention) and take what they need (learning, support, resources, connection). Clear agreements about participation and accountability prevent the "tragedy of the commons" while gift economy principles ensure abundance flows to everyone.</p>

        <!-- Our Core Methodologies -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Our Core Methodologies</h2>
            <p>We use proven approaches that honor emergence over engineering and work with living systems rather than trying to control them:</p>

            <div class="methodology-grid">
                <div class="methodology-card">
                    <h4>Open Space Technology</h4>
                    <p>Large group meetings where the agenda emerges from participants' genuine passions and responsibilities. Based on four principles: "Whoever comes is the right people," "Whatever happens is the only thing that could have," "Whenever it starts is the right time," and "When it's over, it's over." Perfect for organizational visioning and community gatherings where you need to honor diverse voices.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="methodology-card">
                    <h4>Art of Hosting</h4>
                    <p>A collection of practices including circle processes, World Café, and appreciative inquiry that create conditions for collective intelligence to emerge. Focuses on hosting conversations that matter, with practices for holding space across difference and conflict. Includes training for leaders who want to facilitate emergence rather than control outcomes.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="methodology-card">
                    <h4>Circle Processes and Council Methods</h4>
                    <p>Indigenous-rooted practices for decision-making and deep listening. Circle processes involve sitting in a circle where each person has equal voice and opportunity to speak and listen. Council methods create sacred space for wisdom to emerge from the collective, often using a talking piece that moves around the circle. These practices honor all voices and create consensus that serves the whole community.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="methodology-card">
                    <h4>Sociocracy</h4>
                    <p>A governance system based on consent decision-making rather than consensus or hierarchy. Decisions are made when there are no remaining paramount objections (consent) rather than requiring everyone to agree (consensus). Uses a circle structure where each circle has a specific domain of authority and sends representatives to higher circles, creating both autonomy and connection across organizational levels.</p>

                <div class="methodology-card">
                    <h4>Warm Data Labs</h4>
                    <p>Developed by Nora Bateson, these are processes for exploring complex topics through multiple ways of knowing. Warm data is information about the interrelationships that integrate a complex system - not just data points in isolation, but the relationships, patterns, and connections that give systems their life. Labs bring together diverse stakeholders to perceive interdependencies through structured conversations that honor different wisdom traditions.</p>

                <div class="methodology-card">
                    <h4>Gift Economy Principles</h4>
                    <p>Economic relationships where giving creates and maintains relationships rather than ending them. Based on principles like dhana (Buddhist gift-giving that creates spiritual merit), needs-based accessibility (no one turned away for lack of funds), work-trade options, and structures where those with capacity support others' participation. Resources flow based on relationship and reciprocity rather than pure market exchange.</p>

                    <h4>CommDojo (Communication Dojo)</h4>
                    <p>Monthly practice using T-group and Bohm dialogue for authentic communication.

        <!-- Access and Pricing -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Access and Pricing Philosophy</h2>
            <p>We operate with multiple levels of resourcing based on gift economy principles:</p>

            <div class="framework-box">
                <h4>Our Approach to Money and Access:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dhana (Gift Economy):</strong> Contribute what feels right based on your capacity, following Buddhist dana tradition where giving creates spiritual merit and community connection</li>
                    <li><strong>Needs-based Scholarships:</strong> No one turned away for lack of funds - transformation work must be accessible</li>
                    <li><strong>Standard Pricing:</strong> For those with capacity to support their own participation plus others' scholarships</li>
                    <li><strong>Work-trade:</strong> Contribute skills (facilitation, design, documentation) in exchange for participation</li>
                    <li><strong>Organizational Sponsorship:</strong> Companies fund community member access as part of their own learning</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Governance and Decision-Making -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Governance and Decision-Making</h2>
            <p>We use sociocratic principles adapted for network organizing:</p>

            <h3>How Decisions Get Made</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent-based:</strong> Decisions proceed when there are no remaining paramount objections, not when everyone agrees</li>
                <li><strong>Circle structure:</strong> Different domains (community learning, deep dives, organizational support) have autonomy within their areas</li>
                <li><strong>Community input:</strong> Major direction changes discussed in monthly calls and documented openly</li>
                <li><strong>Conflict resolution:</strong> Using our own conflict navigation practices - circle processes and restorative approaches</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Organizational Structure</h3>
            <p>Educational and research work is fiscally sponsored through Inquiring Systems Institute. Consulting and fee-for-service work happens through CrowdWork cooperative. This separation allows us to maintain gift economy principles for learning while ensuring legal protection and sustainability for professional services.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Learning Philosophy -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Our Learning Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Drawing from Nora Bateson's work on mutual learning, we understand learning as the continuous process of adjusting relationships within living systems rather than downloading information.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Learning Through Doing Together</h4>
                <p>Instead of traditional instruction, we use collaborative practice: co-hosting gatherings where you develop facilitation skills in real-time, participating in organizational transformation projects where you learn systems thinking by engaging with actual systems, joining research cohorts where you develop expertise through collaborative inquiry with diverse practitioners.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Transcontextual Learning</h3>
            <p>We recognize that patterns operating in one domain can inform organizing in another. Insights from mycorrhizal networks inform organizational resource sharing. Indigenous council processes transform contemporary decision-making. Sacred geometry appears in both mathematics and ceremonial practice. This isn't metaphorical thinking - it's understanding that the same principles of life, relationship, and emergence apply across all living systems.</p>
