        <!-- Ecosystem Structure -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Our Ecosystem Structure</h2>
            <p>Think of TPOW like a forest ecosystem—each layer enables what grows above it. Like in a forest, each layer feeds and is fed by the others, creating a living cycle that makes the whole ecosystem more resilient and abundant.</p>
            
            <div class="ecosystem-layers">
                <div class="layer-card commons">
                    <h4>Commons Level - The Soil</h4>
                    <p>Like rich forest soil, this is where all the nutrients, relationships, and foundational learning happen. Monthly gatherings, open conversations, shared resources, and collaborative research create the fertile ground where everything else grows. Just as healthy soil supports all plant life, our commons supports all other activities.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="layer-card platform">
                    <h4>Platform & Network Level - The Root System</h4>
                    <p>Like the vast underground network of tree roots and mycorrhizal fungi, this invisible infrastructure connects everything and shares resources. Our "Present of X" initiatives, project tracks like ATEM, and social protocols help people find each other and self-organize around shared interests.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card containers">
                    <h4>Containers Level - The Trees and Plants</h4>
                    <p>Like different species of trees that create distinct micro-environments, these are specific spaces where people can practice and experiment. Starter Cultures, intensive retreats, and workshop series each create their own "climate" for particular kinds of growth.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card applications">
                    <h4>Applications Level - The Fruits and Seeds</h4>
                    <p>Like fruits and seeds that nourish other creatures and spread to create new forests, these are practical offerings that apply our commons wisdom in the wider world. Consulting, training, and transformation projects carry our DNA into new environments.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 24px;"><strong>The magic:</strong> Like in a forest, each layer feeds and is fed by the others. Wisdom flows up from commons through containers to applications, while resources and new learning flow back down, creating a living cycle that makes the whole ecosystem more resilient and abundant.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Four Operational Directions</h2>
            <p>Our ecosystem flows through four operational directions that provide organic structure for daily activities. Understanding these helps you see where your interests and skills might fit.</p>

            <h2>Four Pathways for Exploration</h2>
            <p>These pathways are interconnected ways of engaging that can deepen your capacity for life-affirming work. Think of them as a spiral—you can step in wherever feels most aligned, and they naturally build on each other over time.</p>

            <div class="framework-box">
                <h4>How the pathways work together:</h4>
                <p>You might start by exploring ideas, which leads to joining a project, which inspires you to transform your organization, which develops your skills as a connector. Or you might begin by weaving connections, which helps you see organizational needs, which motivates you to explore the frameworks more deeply.</p>

            <h2>Learning & Governance</h2>
            <p>If you're considering getting involved, you probably want to know how decisions get made and how you'd develop your capabilities within our ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>How We Define Learning</h3>
            <p>Drawing from Nora Bateson's work on "warm data" and mutual learning, we understand learning as the continuous process of adjusting relationships within living systems. Rather than downloading information, learning happens through participating in the patterns that connect—between people, ideas, and contexts.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Our Method: Learning Through Doing Together</h4>
                <p>Instead of traditional instruction, we use collaborative practice. This looks like co-hosting gatherings where you develop facilitation skills in real-time, participating in organizational transformation projects where you learn systems thinking by engaging with actual systems, or joining research cohorts where you develop expertise through collaborative inquiry.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Play and Experimentation</h3>
            <p>We approach learning playfully—trying things, noticing what happens, adjusting, and trying again. For instance, a "Present of Education" group might experiment with different meeting formats each month, reflecting together on what emerges, and gradually developing new ways of learning that serve both individual growth and collective wisdom.</p>

            <h3>Governance as Collective Learning</h3>
            <p>Decisions emerge through distributed leadership and collective sense-making rather than top-down control. Governance becomes a form of mutual learning—sensing what wants to emerge through conversations in monthly gatherings, collaborative research in project tracks, or coordinated experiments across multiple communities.</p>

                    <h4>Organizational Leaders & Hiring Authorities</h4>
                    <p>Your teams can develop real collaboration skills through our approach, not just attend workshops. We offer organizational transformation support that builds internal capacity while achieving business outcomes. Many leaders find this reduces turnover, improves decision-making quality, and increases innovation.</p>

        <!-- Metawork Framework -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Our Metawork Framework</h2>
            <p>We see work not as jobs or careers, but as the fundamental human activity of creating, contributing, and participating in the world. Our framework engages five domains of human experience:</p>

            <div class="framework-box">
                <h4>The Five Domains:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Nurturing authentic connection, care, and co-creation</li>
                    <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Aligning efforts with deepest values and purpose</li>
                    <li><strong>Mastery:</strong> Developing unique gifts and capacities in service of impact</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Sustaining vitality, presence, and wellbeing in work</li>
                    <li><strong>Perspective:</strong> Opening to multiple ways of knowing, being, and creating</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>For example, instead of networking for personal gain, you might practice authentic vulnerability in team meetings (Relationships). Rather than climbing a predetermined career ladder, you might explore how your values can shape the projects you choose (Meaning). Instead of pushing through burnout, you might experiment with sustainable rhythms (Energy).</p>
