            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Revitalizing human activity from industrial job to sacred practice</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Origins -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Our Origins</h2>
            
            <div class="origin-story">
                <p><strong>The Present of Work is a learning network exploring how we can transform our relationship with work itself - moving from "Work" (industrial jobs focused on productivity and profit) to "work" (sacred practice that serves life and deepens our connection to community and the living world).</strong></p>
                
                <p>Founded by practitioners who experienced firsthand the disconnection between conventional work structures and human flourishing, we started as a small group exploring what regenerative work relationships might look like. Drawing from indigenous wisdom traditions like the Quechua understanding of <em>llankay</em> (work integrated with love and wisdom), Buddhist concepts of right livelihood, and proven methodologies like Open Space Technology and Art of Hosting.</p>
                
                <p>Like fermentation cultures that break down what was into something new and nourishing, our work creates conditions for the transformation of work itself. What began as intimate conversations about meaning and purpose has evolved into a living commonsâ€”a shared space where we're building platforms of relationships and weaving networks of meaning that enable people to live lives of purpose and contribution.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Our Three-Layer Learning Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>We organize learning through three interconnected layers that function like living systems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil/Commons:</strong> Free resources, community calls, and open-source wisdom that feeds all our work</li>
                <li><strong>Knots:</strong> Skill-building dojos and guilds where people develop capacities while tending relationships</li>
                <li><strong>Social Web:</strong> Deep dive explorations and organizational support that translates individual learning into collective impact</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Our network operates on gift economy principles while maintaining sustainability through a hybrid model that separates educational work (fiscally sponsored through Inquiring Systems Institute) from consulting services (through our CrowdWork cooperative).</p>

            <h2>Current Focus: Alternatives to Extractive Methods (ATEM)</h2>
            
            <div class="atem-highlight">
                <h4>Reimagining Philanthropy Lab - Starting 2025</h4>
                <p>Our first Alternatives to Extractive Methods (ATEM) cohort focuses on reimagining philanthropy beyond the usual frameworks of trust-based philanthropy, impact philanthropy, or effective altruism. We're bringing together stakeholders from the philanthropy world - funders, recipients, intermediaries, and critics - to explore how we can transform our relationship from extractive and transactional ways of navigating the world.</p>
                
                <p>Using our soil, web, and knotting practices, we'll help participants think differently about wealth, power, relationship, and reciprocity. This isn't about tweaking existing models - it's about exploring what becomes possible when we approach philanthropy as gift economy, as relational tending, as participation in the web of life.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Applications open:</strong> Contact us if you're involved in philanthropy and want to explore alternatives to extractive methods.</p>
            </div>

            <p>ATEM represents our exploration of alternatives to extractive methods across all domains - from money and resources to relationships and knowledge. The core question: How do we shift from taking from the world to participating in the ongoing creation of the world?</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Vision -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>What We're Working Toward</h2>
            
            <div class="vision-box">
                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>We envision communities of practice sprouting everywhereâ€”"The Present of Education," "The Present of Healthcare," "The Present of Technology"â€”each applying these frameworks to their domain while contributing insights back to the broader ecosystem. We see new organizational forms emerging that operate from principles of wholeness, regeneration, and shared prosperity.</p>
                
                <p>This isn't about replacing existing systems overnight, but creating parallel structures and demonstrating what becomes possible when we organize around our full humanity.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Why Now?</h3>
            <p>The old models of work clearly aren't serving us or the planet. Climate change, inequality, mental health crises, and social fragmentation are all connected to extractive approaches to human activity. At the same time, we have unprecedented opportunities to create new forms of collaboration, learning, and impact.</p>

            <h3>The Three Meanings of "Present"</h3>
            <p>When we speak of the "present of work," we invoke three profound dimensions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Present as Presence:</strong> Full engagement with what is actually here, bringing complete attention to whatever we're tending</li>
                <li><strong>Present as Present Moment:</strong> Work rooted in this moment rather than anxious projection into future outcomes</li>
                <li><strong>Present as Gift:</strong> Work as offering that strengthens rather than depletes the web of life through relational tending</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Core Principles -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Core Principles</h2>
            <p>These aren't just nice ideasâ€”they're our core beliefs that actively guide how we make decisions, design gatherings, approach projects, and relate to each other. They represent a fundamental shift from extractive to regenerative ways of being and working together.</p>

                <div class="principle-card wholeness">
                    <h4>Meeting Not Matching</h4>
                    <p>We practice deep listening and curiosity about how situations came to be, responding to what's actually present rather than imposing predetermined solutions. Instead of matching our frameworks to problems, we meet each situation with genuine inquiry about what wants to emerge.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle-card fractal">
                    <h4>Gift-Based Economics</h4>
                    <p>We design economic relationships that honor both offering authentic gifts and receiving material support, creating relational tending through how resources flow. This means dhana (gift economy), needs-based scholarships, work-trade, and structures where giving creates connection rather than ending it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle-card systems">
                    <h4>Transcontextual Learning</h4>
                    <p>We recognize that patterns operating in one domain (like mycorrhizal networks) can inform organizing in another (like resource flow in organizations). Insights from nature inform business, wisdom from indigenous cultures illuminates technology design, patterns from healthy families guide community organizing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle-card complexity">
                    <h4>Emergence Over Engineering</h4>
                    <p>Like gardener-conveners rather than mechanical engineers, we create conditions for what wants to emerge rather than trying to control outcomes. We trust in organic intelligence and work with the grain of living systems.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <div class="acknowledgments-box">
                <h4>Why focus on "work" specifically?</h4>
                <p>Work is where most adults spend the majority of their waking hours, yet it's often the domain of life most disconnected from our values, creativity, and sense of purpose. As anthropologist David Graeber argued in "Bullshit Jobs," much of contemporary work feels meaningless even to those doing it. Political theorist Kathi Weeks challenges us in "The Problem with Work" to imagine life beyond the work ethic that subordinates all other values to productivity.</p>
                <p>We see work as both a site of exploitation AND a potential space of liberation. When we transform our relationship with work, we transform our relationship with power, community, and meaning itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="acknowledgments-box">
                <h4>How is this different from other "future of work" approaches?</h4>
                <p>Most "future of work" discourse focuses on adapting humans to technological changeâ€”remote work tools, gig economy platforms, AI collaboration. We're interested in the deeper question: How do we organize human activity to serve life rather than extract from it?</p>
                <p>Rather than making work more efficient, we're asking whether current definitions of productivity actually serve human and planetary wellbeing. Instead of optimizing individuals for existing systems, we're experimenting with new systems that honor human wholeness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="acknowledgments-box">
                <h4>What influenced this approach?</h4>
                <p><strong>Critical work theory:</strong> Kathi Weeks' critique of the work ethic, David Graeber's analysis of meaningless labor, and feminist economists' recognition of care work as essential but devalued.</p>
                <p><strong>Systems thinking:</strong> Nora Bateson's "warm data" approach to understanding complex relationships, Gregory Bateson's insights into patterns that connect, and ecological thinking that sees humans as part of larger living systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Indigenous wisdom:</strong> Quechua concepts of llankay, ayni (reciprocity), and understanding work as ceremony and gift to the more-than-human world.</p>
                <p><strong>Contemplative traditions:</strong> Buddhist concepts of right livelihood, practices of presence, and seeing work as spiritual practice.</p>
                <p><strong>Alternative economics:</strong> Gift economy research, cooperative movement history, and contemporary experiments in post-capitalist organizing.</p>

                <h4>Intellectual Foundations</h4>
                <p>This work builds on wisdom from diverse sources: indigenous traditions like Andean cosmovision and Buddhist right livelihood, contemporary approaches like Open Space Technology and Art of Hosting, and insights from thinkers like RaimÃ³n Panikkar (who explored radical relationality), Nora Bateson (who studies complex systems), and David Graeber (who analyzed the anthropology of work). We also draw from gift economy principles, contemplative practices, and emergence-based facilitation methodologies.</p>

        <!-- What We're Still Learning -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>What We're Still Learning</h2>
            <p>We're not perfect, and we want to be honest about our limitations and areas where we need more wisdom:</p>

            <div class="gaps-box">
                <h4>Economic Realism Gap</h4>
                <p>Our approaches work well for people with some financial flexibility, but we haven't adequately addressed the needs of people with significant financial obligationsâ€”mortgages, student loans, medical debt, family support responsibilitiesâ€”who can't easily transition to potentially lower-income regenerative work. We're actively seeking input from people in these circumstances to design more realistic pathways.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gaps-box">
                <h4>Cultural Bridge Building</h4>
                <p>Our ecosystem currently attracts people already somewhat aligned with regenerative values. We recognize we're missing pathways for engaging people from conservative backgrounds, traditional business environments, or those skeptical of alternative economic models. We want to invite voices from these communities to help us understand how to build approaches that work for them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gaps-box">
                <h4>Scaling Without Losing Soul</h4>
                <p>How do we maintain depth and quality as our network grows? How do we prevent the commons from being diluted or appropriated? We're still developing robust ways to measure success and address situations where our approaches cause unintended harm or simply don't work as intended.</p>
            </div>
